### Making an Application
The making of an application as a mod for DT Technologies' phone is relatively simple.

Making a GUI is very easy if you studied and are use to work with the horrible Arma 3 GUI system! 

Otherwise, it is a learning curve with a lot of outdated and wrong information available to lead you to your GUI demise! if you have any GUI related questions concerning the application making process for DT you should contact [Orka](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971902294/).

### Prerequesite
1. Knowledge of Mod Making (config.cpp, PBO packing and publishing), if not get on that before as i will not cover how to create mods i start from the assumption you already know.
1. Knowledge of GUI (defines.hpp, GUI controls, import classes in config.cpp and include files.)

With that you should be ready to quickly get to work.

### Preparing the work
1. Create a mod Folder, referred to ``prefix_my_mod`` as of now.
2. Inside prefix_my_mod, create ``config.cpp`` and inside the CfgPatches for the mod information, you should know that.
    - Note: broken Arma 3, any mods adding defines.hpp in the config.cpp having a ``requiredAddons`` dependency defined will see the game UI crashed and broken. DO NOT create dependencies on the same CfgPatches of the GUI.

[--HighlightCode(Language="cpp")--]class CfgPatches
{
	class prefix_my_mod
	{
		author = "YOU";
		name = "My Mod Name";
		units[]={ };
		weapons[]={};
		requiredVersion=0.1;
		requiredAddons[]={ }; // DO NOT make any dependency here as this config.cpp serve to include GUI classes.
	};
};[--/HighlightCode--]

3. Create a folder inside prefix_my_mod ``data/gui``
3. Create a file inside ``prefix_my_mod/data/gui`` of any name referred to ``my_app.hpp`` from here on.
3. Open my_app.hpp and paste the below code.

[--HighlightCode(Language="cpp")--]class BSM_DT_Tablet_BASE {
    class controls {
		class Frame_Base;
		class Frame_Base_Picture;
		class Button_Home_Base;
		class Button_Up_Base;
		class Button_Down_Base;
		class Button_Exit_Base;
    };
};[--/HighlightCode--]

This will import the base class of the application for the phone's background.

### Creating the App

1. Open Arma 3 GUI editor and start making you GUI you can open phone base class to help you match grid and screen area the class name is ``BSM_DT_Tablet_BASE``.
    - Note: loading Arma 3 should be done with the mod ``BSM - DT Technologies`` loaded.
2. Paste the export GUI code into ``my_app.hpp`` after the previously added code.

Now assuming you have deleted the base app GUI element before exporting, you should have only you application controls information and this is what we want here.

Add couple of break line between the newly pasted code and the previously adde code.

Paste the following between.

[--HighlightCode(Language="cpp")--]class prefix_my_app : BSM_DT_Tablet_BASE {
    class controls : controls {
		class Frame_Base : Frame_Base { };
		class Frame_Base_Picture : Frame_Base_Picture { };
		class Button_Home_Base : Button_Home_Base { };
		class Button_Up_Base : Button_Up_Base { 
			// action = "[(_this # 0)] call SpecOps_fnc_chestPhoneHomeScreenUp;";
		};
		class Button_Down_Base : Button_Down_Base {
			// action = "[(_this # 0)] call SpecOps_fnc_chestPhoneHomeScreenDown;";
		};
		class Button_Exit_Base : Button_Exit_Base { };  
    };
};[--/HighlightCode--]

This is the skeleton base of our app and if you were to open this app it would be the phone frame only with only the ability to close the app and close the phone.

You can see also ``Button_Up_Base`` and ``Button_Down_Base`` which by default as no action at all can be configure... well all of them can be but those 2 are the most useful as it can help you have pagination.

Now you will copy everything inside ``class controls {`` from the code you have exported from the GUI editor and paste it inside the control of ``prefix_my_app``, after ``Button_Exit_base``.

You can remove artifact code from the exported GUI as it will be no longer useful.

The full class of the app should like something like that

[--HighlightCode(Language="cpp")--]class prefix_my_app : BSM_DT_Tablet_BASE {
    class controls : controls {
		class Frame_Base : Frame_Base { };
		class Frame_Base_Picture : Frame_Base_Picture { };
		class Button_Home_Base : Button_Home_Base { };
		class Button_Up_Base : Button_Up_Base { 
			// action = "[(_this # 0)] call SpecOps_fnc_chestPhoneHomeScreenUp;";
		};
		class Button_Down_Base : Button_Down_Base {
			// action = "[(_this # 0)] call SpecOps_fnc_chestPhoneHomeScreenDown;";
		};
		class Button_Exit_Base : Button_Exit_Base { };  

        class RscStructuredText_1100: RscStructuredText
        {
            idc = 1100;
            text = "We  made a hide all not needed stuff out side the mission area by using the Hide Map area Moduel, it vill boost frames just name it bs_hide .";
            x = 0.304062 * safezoneW + safezoneX;
            y = 0.35 * safezoneH + safezoneY;
            w = 0.154687 * safezoneW;
            h = 0.22 * safezoneH;
        };
        
        class RscStructuredText_1101: RscStructuredText
        {
            idc = 1101;
            text = "To save a drawing on the map so you can paste it again after reload.. good for like mission briefing drawings.   Start by Drawing a Picture then klick the Button to save it to memory.";
            x = 0.304062 * safezoneW + safezoneX;
            y = 0.54 * safezoneH + safezoneY;
            w = 0.144375 * safezoneW;
            h = 0.12 * safezoneH;
        };

    };
};
[--/HighlightCode--]

Now this is ready to use and the whole ``my_app.hpp`` should look like this

[--HighlightCode(Language="cpp")--]class BSM_DT_Tablet_BASE {
    class controls {
		class Frame_Base;
		class Frame_Base_Picture;
		class Button_Home_Base;
		class Button_Up_Base;
		class Button_Down_Base;
		class Button_Exit_Base;
    };
};


class prefix_my_app : BSM_DT_Tablet_BASE {
    class controls : controls {
		class Frame_Base : Frame_Base { };
		class Frame_Base_Picture : Frame_Base_Picture { };
		class Button_Home_Base : Button_Home_Base { };
		class Button_Up_Base : Button_Up_Base { 
			// action = "[(_this # 0)] call SpecOps_fnc_chestPhoneHomeScreenUp;";
		};
		class Button_Down_Base : Button_Down_Base {
			// action = "[(_this # 0)] call SpecOps_fnc_chestPhoneHomeScreenDown;";
		};
		class Button_Exit_Base : Button_Exit_Base { };  

        class RscStructuredText_1100: RscStructuredText
        {
            idc = 1100;
            text = "We  made a hide all not needed stuff out side the mission area by using the Hide Map area Moduel, it vill boost frames just name it bs_hide .";
            x = 0.304062 * safezoneW + safezoneX;
            y = 0.35 * safezoneH + safezoneY;
            w = 0.154687 * safezoneW;
            h = 0.22 * safezoneH;
        };
        
        class RscStructuredText_1101: RscStructuredText
        {
            idc = 1101;
            text = "To save a drawing on the map so you can paste it again after reload.. good for like mission briefing drawings.   Start by Drawing a Picture then klick the Button to save it to memory.";
            x = 0.304062 * safezoneW + safezoneX;
            y = 0.54 * safezoneH + safezoneY;
            w = 0.144375 * safezoneW;
            h = 0.12 * safezoneH;
        };

    };
};

### Register the App
1. Open ``config.cpp``
1. Add the following code at the begining.

You can either use our defines if it simple uncustomized GUI elements or use your own.

[--HighlightCode(Language="cpp")--]#include "\bsm_chest_phone\data\gui\defines.hpp"
#include "\prefix_my_mod\data\gui\my_app.hpp"[--/HighlightCode--]


1. Add the following code at the end.

[--HighlightCode(Language="cpp")--]class bsm_chest_phone_dt {
	class prefix_my_app {
		name = "Polyliner Tool"; // APP NAME
		icon = "\bsm_polyliner\data\icons\icon_app_bsm_polyliner.paa"; // USE YOU OWN
		dialog = "prefix_my_app"; // THE CLASSNAME OF THE GUI
	};
};
