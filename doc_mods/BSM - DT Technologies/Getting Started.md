## What is DT Technologies?
DT Research is a Rugged Tactical Tablet/Phone solution provider for the military in real life. 

We have implemented the design and system for use in game.


## Features
- Base Screen Design
    - Any GUI developer can use our system to create a mobile app screen for our phone with graphical fonctionality.
    
    - Registering an app is just as easy as creating an ACE interaction... Run the function register and tell it its behavior and boom that is it! the app icon is available on the screen menu.

    - Immersive Sounds when opening and closing the phone.
